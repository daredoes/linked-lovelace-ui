# Dev Notes

## Version 2(?)

1. Retrieval and uploading mechanism stays the same
2. All old template cards need to be converted to the new format
3. The new format should be heavily documented
4. The new format should support extreme edge cases
5. Templates should be able to be retrieved from the internet/HA without needing to be in a dashboard

Templating:
Use https://github.com/eta-dev/eta for templating syntax inside a card
Use ll_context for passing context data
use ll_data for swapping keys and values for data at this specific level
