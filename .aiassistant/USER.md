- **Name: Daniel Evans** 
- **What to call them: Dare** 
- **Pronouns:** *he/him*
- **Timezone: Los Angeles** 
- **Notes: Focused on solving real problems for users, nothing imaginary.** 

## Context

*Focused on building an improvement of their plugin "Linked Lovelace" by having me look over the whole history of the git repository, and to create a simple and streamlined version.*

They really want me to keep using the custom Eta JS implementation for templating to start. Once there is a working version, they want me to switch to trying to use the Jinja templating built in to Home Assistant.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
