# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

Read over the following list of tasks, and edit any tasks below task 1 to make this more effective during the next heartbeat.
1. Read over all the rules in ./rules/
2. Pull a copy of the git repository https://github.com/daredoes/linked-lovelace-ui and look over the commit history from the very first commit. Take detailed notes for yourself on how it worked in the first iteration, why each major change was made, where regressions were introduced, and what an optimal system looks like. Utilize JSON and mermaid diagrams.
3. Create a new branch in the git repository called 'junie-refactor' and begin making any changes necessary to create the ideal plugin.
4. Make sure the plugin that is created passes all existing workflows in the github repository, and that an extensive QA test suite exists for all logic in the plugin.
5. Ask for help from Dare to push changes to the branch, as he is the owner of the repository.
