type: 'custom:linked-lovelace'
ll_template: 'complex_nested_template'
ll_context:
  level1:
    title: "Level 1 Card"
    level2:
      title: "Level 2 Card"
      level3:
        title: "Level 3 Card"
          level4:
            title: "Level 4 Card"

# - Context should be properly passed through the chain
# - Each level should have access to its title
